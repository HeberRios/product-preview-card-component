## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The use of the <picture> element along with a <source> and an <img> element to show different
versions of an image for different display/device scenarios.

### Continued development

Have a better understanding of semantic HTML and fluid typography.

### Useful resources

-   [Why use rem instead of px](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCSw6bPXZks) - This taught me
    a new best practice for responsive design.

-   [Use of clamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erqRw3E-vn4&t=202s) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand CSS clamp better. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
